Description: Simulating single cell RNA-seq data with complicated structure. This package is developed based on the Splat method (Zappia, Phipson and Oshlack (2017) <doi:10.1186/s13059-017-1305-0>). 'GeneScape' incorporates additional features to simulate single cell RNA-seq data with complicated differential expression and correlation structures, such as sub-cell-types, correlated genes (pathway genes) and hub genes.
